Stories and Acceptance Criteria
As a lender, I want to be able to check my available funds, so that I know how much money I can offer for loans.

When I check my available funds
Then I should see how much funds I currently have
As a lender, I want to add money to my available funds, so that I can offer loans to potential home buyers.

Given I have <current_amount> available funds
When I add <deposit_amount>
Then my available funds should be <total>

Examples:
| current_amount | deposit_amount |   total  |
|     100,000    |      50,000    | 150,000  |
|     200,000    |      30,000    | 230,000  |
As a lender, I want to accept and qualify loan applications, so that I can ensure I get my money back.

Rule: To qualify for the full amount, candidates must have debt-to-income (DTI) less than 36%, credit score above 620 
and savings worth 25% of requested loan amount.

Rule: To partially qualify, candidates must still meet the same dti and credit score thresholds. 
The loan amount for partial qualified applications is four times the applicant's savings.

Given a loan applicant with <dti>, <credit_score>, and <savings>
When they apply for a loan with <requested_amount>
Then their qualification is <qualification>
And their loan amount is <loan_amount>
And their loan status is <status>

Example:
|  requested_amount  |   dti  |  credit_score  |  savings  |     qualification    |  loan_amount  |   status   |
|      250,000       |   21   |       700      | 100,000   |       qualified      |   250,000     |  qualified |
|      250,000       |   37   |       700      | 100,000   |     not qualified    |         0     |  denied    |
|      250,000       |   30   |       600      | 100,000   |     not qualified    |         0     |  denied    |
|      250,000       |   30   |       700      |  50,000   |  partially qualified |   200,000     |  qualified |
As a lender, I want to only approve loans when I have available funds, so that I don't go bankrupt.

Given I have <available_funds> in available funds
When I process a qualified loan
Then the loan status is set to <status>

Example:
| loan_amount | available_funds |    status  |
|   125,000   |    100,000      |   on hold  |
|   125,000   |    200,000      |  approved  |
|   125,000   |    125,000      |  approved  |

When I process a not qualified loan
Then I should see a warning to not proceed
As a lender, I want to keep pending loan amounts in a separate account, so I don't extend too many offers and bankrupt myself.

Given I have approved a loan
Then the requested loan amount is moved from available funds to pending funds
And I see the available and pending funds reflect the changes accordingly
As a lender, I want to process response for approved loans, so that I can move forward with the loan.

Given I have an approved loan
When the applicant accepts my loan offer
Then the loan amount is removed from the pending funds
And the loan status is marked as accepted

Given I have an approved loan
When the applicant rejects my loan offer
Then the loan amount is moved from the pending funds back to available funds
And the loan status is marked as rejected
As a lender, I want to check if there are any undecided loans, so that I can manage my time and money wisely.

Rule: approved loans expired in 3 days

Given there is an approved loan offered more than 3 days ago
When I check for expired loans
Then the loan amount is move from the pending funds back to available funds
And the loan status is marked as expired
As a lender, I want to filter loans by status, so that I can have an overview.

Given there are loans in my system
When I search by loan status (qualified, denied, on hold, approved, accepted, rejected, expired)
Then I should see a list of loans and their details
